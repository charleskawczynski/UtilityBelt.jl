TODO: This can return an enormous number of files.
      Predicting which files to include / exclude
      is difficult to do automatically. However,
      we could make this easier by:
       - taking the result and counting the number of
         files per subdirectory
       - sorting this list
       - Asking the user if they would like to include
         or exclude folders in N (also provided by user)
         subdirectories with the most number of matched files
